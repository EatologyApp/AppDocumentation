  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Eatology Team ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy.
    This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information
    when you use the Eatology mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you
    agree to the practices described in this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Email address, name, and Google account data if you choose to sign in using Google authentication (available in future updates).</li>
    <li><strong>Media Access:</strong> With your permission, the App may access your camera and photo gallery solely for functional purposes (e.g., uploading a photo to your profile or saving favorite recipes).</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Non-personal data such as device type, operating system, language preferences, and usage behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> In future versions, we may collect payment-related data via Google Play Billing. We do not store this information directly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not store any personal data unless required for core features of the app, and we delete all user data upon request or account removal.</p>

  <h2>3. Use of Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements. AdMob may collect and process data
    such as your device ID, IP address, and usage behavior to display personalized ads.
  </p>
  <p>You can review Google’s advertising data practices here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>
  <p>You can opt out of personalized ads through your device settings.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core functionality of the App</li>
    <li>Analyze app performance and improve user experience</li>
    <li>Deliver relevant advertisements</li>
    <li>Respond to user inquiries and feedback</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take appropriate administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your
    data. However, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
    security of your information.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or rent your personal data. We only share information with trusted
    third-party service providers (e.g., AdMob, Firebase) strictly as necessary to
    support the App's functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your country, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal data</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent to data collection</li>
    <li>Request a copy of the data we hold</li>
    <li>Opt out of personalized advertising</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For any privacy concerns or requests, contact us at: <a href="mailto:Eatologyapp@gmail.com">Eatologyapp@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from
    children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected data from a child, please
    contact us, and we will delete the information promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    As a globally available app, your data may be processed in countries outside your
    jurisdiction. We ensure that such transfers comply with applicable data protection
    laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal
    requirements. We will notify users via the App or another appropriate channel.
    Continued use of the App after changes implies acceptance of the updated policy.
